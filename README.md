# Pixim-Camera-Module-Tester
I wrote this tool back in 2008, to test a camera modula from Pixim (used with the DM355). As the module didn't come with a specs manual, I monitored the communications between the PC and the Camera and then wrote this protocol. Feel free to use it if you think it'll help you any way.
